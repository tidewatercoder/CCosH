# CCosH or Copy, Compress, and/or Hash
- The code allows the user to copy/compress a specific file and/or copy/compress multiple files from a directory tree.                       
- The user can also request all the files to be hashed before and after being copied to make sure that all the data is still intact after the copy is made.                 
- When compressing, the files are only hashed before they are compressed. When the user uncompress the files, they can request them to be 
hashed again to check for integrity.                                              
- After the file are hashed a text file 'Hashedfiles.txt' (v0.4.0-alpha)/'hashedfile.txt' (v1.0.0) will be added to the directory of the copied files.
