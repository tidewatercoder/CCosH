# CCosH or Copy, Compress, and/or Hash
- I am improving on the code even more.
- The code allows the user to copy and/or compress large amount of files including their directories at once.                            
- The user can also request all the files to be hashed before and after being copied to make sure that all the data is still intact after the copy is made.                 
- However, when compressing, the files are only hashed before they are compressed. When the user uncompress the files, they can request them to be 
hashed again to check for integrity.                                              
- For both copied files and the compress file, a hashed file is created and stored in the folder for later reference.
